\chapter{Requirements}
\label{chapRequirements}

The functional and non-functional requirements of the Fault Manager Lite application are gathered in the next sections of the document.

Functional requirements are organized into their corresponding subsystems. If any requirement could depend on two or more subsystems due to the function it performs, then one of those subsystems (usually the most relevant) will be chosen.

In a similar way, non-functional requirements are organized into categories attending to their scope.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Task Management}

\begin{requirement}{Generate repair task}
\reqdesc When the report system receives a new fault report, it will analyze the information it contains in order to generate its corresponding repair task. This task will later be automatically assigned to a technician.
\reqin The fault report sent by an user of the application.
\reqsteps The system will analyze the information of this fault report and generate its corresponding repair task. That task will be classified depending on its category and priority, and saved in the fault database.

\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Visualize new notices of incidences}
\reqdesc Managers will be able to see new notices of incidences that have not been assigned yet, in order to revise their correctness.
\reqin Function triggered manually by the manager by selecting its corresponding option.
\reqsteps Depending on the department the manager is in charge of, the system will look in the fault database for new notices of incidences of that department that are still not solved nor assigned to any technician.
\reqout The system will display a list of incidence reports. Information about each report will also be shown to see their correctness.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Definition of priority criteria}
\reqdesc The system must allow to specify different criteria to assign automatically a priority to each incidence.
\reqin The user selects parameters of the incidence object and corresponding keywords that will conform the selection criteria, and the desired priority that will be set on match.
\reqsteps The system stores the criteria and applies it automatically on incidence creation in order to establish a priority.
\reqout The system automatically classifies each incidence based on user-defined criteria: if a certain parameter (e.g., location or description) contains the keywords specified, the priority will be set to whatever the user specified in the criteria.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Management of priorities by managers}
