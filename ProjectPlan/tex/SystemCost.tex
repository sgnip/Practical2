\section{Cost management}

\subsection{Personnel costs}

We consider the following salaries for the required positions for the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item Systems Analyst: 400 \euro / day.
\item Senior Designer: 350 \euro / day.
\item Junior Designer: 200 \euro / day.
\item Systems Technician: 300 \euro / day.
\end{itemize}

These values will be used as the fixed cost for personnel throughout this document estimations.

\subsection{Hardware costs}

For the project, three workstations must be acquired for development (1.650 \euro per unit) and another one for performance testing (3.200 \euro). Total hardware cost is then 8.150 \euro.

Additionally, the maintenance cost for current hardware and software is 1.050 \euro per month.

\subsection{Software costs}

A new integrated development environment will also be acquired, at a cost of 1,100 \euro per workstation. This environment includes all necessary software for the lifecycle of the project.
