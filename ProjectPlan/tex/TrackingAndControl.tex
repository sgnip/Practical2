\section{Change management}

Details for the changes in the project configuration will be outlined in the Configuration Management Document.

\section{Progress monitorization}

Before the project starts, a meeting is planned for \textcolor{red}{TODO: FIX THIS DATE} where both representatives of Triforce and UAM will review and, if it corresponds, approve the project plan. Then, project will start.

Meetings are planned at each phase (Analysis, Design, Coding, Testing and Deployment) of each increment as reflected on table \ref{tblPlannedMeetings}. Each phase and its deliverables will be reviewed at these meetings.

It is mandatory that the responsible of each phase and the manager are present in each meeting. Other Triforce employees interested can attend with previous approval from the responsible of the meeting.
