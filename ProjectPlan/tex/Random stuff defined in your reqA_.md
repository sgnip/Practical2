### Things to agree
- Should the inputs be a list or a phrase? In the example given they are in phrases but DJ thinks it clearer as a list. Just DJ is the weird using a list.
- Reported fault object (A1,A4) or Incidence object (A2)

## Req A1 - Notification of incidences

If've defined kind of randomly:

- Location object.
- Reported fault object.
- User object with contact information.
- Faults are stored into database with fields: **title**, **category**, **priority**, **location object**, **picture**
- 


## Req A2


## Req A3


## Req A4 - Management of priority categorization

- Department chief object (subking of user object).
