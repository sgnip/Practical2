\begin{abstract}
In order to improve their performance, more and more maintenance services in charge of different entities or organizations have started to automate their labor using technologies and software systems specially designed taking into account the needs this sector has.

In this document, we outline and detail the project plan for the Fault Manager Lite system, a proposal for the UAM that will solve their problems regarding maintenance efficiency. An estimate for the size, time and cost of the system will be derived and presented, together with a plan and schedule to make this project real.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapIntroduction}

The Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) has reported the numerous problems it has detecting faults that arise on its campus and its facilities, whose reparation usually takes excessive time and is poorly organized. A late detection of faults in the facilities delays its reparation, stopping its users to continue using them as normal and complicating the maintenance staff labor. Regarding the wishes of the campus users and realizing the potential maintenance problems it has, the UAM has organized a contest to choose the best project proposal that solves them.

This is where our organization, Triforce, enters the scene: we have analyzed the problem exhaustively and designed a web application, Fault Manager Lite (FML), that meets all the requirements expected, solves the problems and also includes new extra features that makes it even more useful.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this Project Plan document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the project and estimations of the size of the whole system. Based on these aspects, we introduce our proposed planning for the development, including related estimates such as cost and duration.

The intended audience of this document is the executive team of Triforce, in order to know and evaluate the resource allocation for the project and its fit in the company and its activities.

\section{Structure}

The document is structured as follows. This chapter serves as introduction and description of the document and its contents. Chapter \ref{chapSubsystems} contains the definition of the subsystems that will conform the project and their associated requirements.

In chapter \ref{chapProjectSizeEstimations} we present the estimations for the size of the system. Our planned schedule and cost estimations is presented in chapter \ref{chapPlan} and, finally, chapter \ref{chapTracking} shows the proposal for the project tracking and control.

The appendices contain extra information, such as detailed function point estimation (appendix \ref{chapFunctionPoints}), Cocomo II Cost estimation (appendix \ref{chapCocomo}) and the detailed Gantt diagram (appendix \ref{chapGantt}).

\chapter{Cocomo II Cost Estimation}
\label{chapCocomo}

Table \ref{tblCocomoDetail} reflects the estimation of costs for the smallest subsystem, the fault reporting. The size parameters has been extracted from table \ref{tbl_RSS_UFP}.

\begin{table}[hbtp]
\centering
\input{../CommonTex/CocomoCostFaultReport.tex}
\caption{Detailed report of the estimation using the CoCoMo II method}
\label{tblCocomoDetail}
\end{table}

The estimation approximately coincides with the one given based on the function points method ($\sim$ 9,000 \euro\ in labour costs). It's worth noting that this estimation has been calculated as if it were the first prototype of the project - it includes software and hardware costs, which are unique for the project - and that it doesn't take into account work parallelization.

\section{COCOMO II parameters}


% % I have used http://csse.usc.edu/csse/research/COCOMOII/cocomo2000.0/CII_modelman2000.0.pdf to invent justifications of parameters.


\subsection{Personnel parameters}
\paragraph{Analyst Capability (ACAP) } \textit{High}

The analyst assigned to the project are the best ones we have. They work almost without mistakes, they are above 80 percentil, according to CMMI.

\paragraph{Programmer Capability (PCAP) } \textit{High}

Our programmers are very well formed and they work with very few mistakes, they are above 80 percentil, according to CMMI.

\paragraph{Personnel Continuity (PCON) } \textit{Nominal}

We were in 14\% of project's annual turnovers during 2013 and 13.35\% during 2014.

\paragraph{Applications Experience (APEX) } \textit{Nominal}

As this is not a very complex system, we want some new people to work with experienced ones, so they can learn better how we work in Triforce. When we are talking about new people, we talk about people with experience between 1 year and 2 that had been working in some similar project. 


\paragraph{Platform Experience (PLEX) } \textit{High}

We are very used to the platform we will work with. 

\paragraph{Language and Tool Experience (LTEX) } \textit{Nominal}

We are not very used to new standard HTML5, but we are with other languages, such as SQL and JavaScript.


\subsection{Project parameters}
\paragraph{Use of Software Tools (TOOL) } \textit{Very High}

We have been working in Software Engineering for the past 15 years so we are very very used with Software tools.

\paragraph{Multisite Development (SITE) } \textit{High}

The team will work all of them in the same city, but not all of them in the same building.

\paragraph{Required Development Schedule (SCED) } \textit{Nominal} - The plan will be followed with no delays or overtakes. 

\subsection{Product parameters}

\paragraph{Required Software Reliability (RELY) }\textit{ Low}

The possible losses are easily recoverable.


\paragraph{Data Base Size (DATA) }\textit{ Nominal}

D/P coefficient using approximate database size estimation is 43 (between 10 and 100)


\paragraph{Product Complexity (CPLX) }\textit{ Low }

The program will have straightforward nesting of structured programming operators.  No cognizance of particular processor or I/O device characteristics is needed. We will use of simple graphic user interface (GUI) builders. 


\paragraph{Developed for Reusability (RUSE):}  \textit{Nominal}

We won't focus on developing for re-usability but in requirements, but we won't make effort in developing uniquely so it won't be reusable.

\paragraph{Documentation Match to Life-Cycle Needs (DOCU)} \textit{nominal} 

Documentation is important but we have been debugging how much effort we spend in documentation and we discovered the optimum amount of documentation we need for maintenance.

\subsection{Platform parameters}
\paragraph{Execution Time Constraint  (TIME)} \textit{nominal} 

We won't focus on execution time. It's not a very complex system to use loads of resources but it has many functionalities.

\paragraph{Main Storage Constraint (STOR)} \textit{nominal}

We won't focus on Main Storage and we estimate the system won't need more than 50\% of the Main Memory.


\paragraph{Platform Volatility (PVOL) } \textit{low}

Just OS updates or new software releases for database. This updates will be taken into account less frequently than once a year.
